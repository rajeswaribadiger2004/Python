1. Write a python program to add two numbers. 
2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z. 
3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function. 
4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than 
‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80 
5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user. 
6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.


1.
  # Adding two numbers
a = 5
b = 7
sum_result = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum_result)

2.
# Finding remainder
num = 27
z = 5
remainder = num % z
print("The remainder is:", remainder)

3.
# Checking type of input variable
x = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", x)
print("Type of variable is:", type(x))

4.
# Average of two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
average = (num1 + num2) / 2
print("The average is:", average)

5.
# Square of a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
square = num ** 2
print("The square is:", square)
